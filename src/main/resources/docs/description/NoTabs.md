# NoTabs

This rule reports if tabs are used in Kotlin files.
According to
[Google's Kotlin style guide](https://android.github.io/kotlin-guides/style.html#whitespace-characters)
the only whitespace chars that are allowed in a source file are the line terminator sequence
and the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20).
