# TooManyFunctions

This rule reports files, classes, interfaces, objects and enums which contain too many functions.
Each element can be configured with different thresholds.

Too many functions indicate a violation of the single responsibility principle. Prefer extracting functionality
which clearly belongs together in separate parts of the code.
