## Description

See [ktlint docs](### Linting Error: Inconsistent Spacing Around Operators

#### Description
This linting error occurs when there is inconsistent spacing around operators in your Kotlin code. Consistent spacing improves readability and helps maintain a clean code style, making it easier for you and your team to understand and maintain the code.

#### Example of the Error
Consider the following code snippet:

```kotlin
val foo1 = 1 + 2
val foo2=3 * 4
```

In this example, the spacing around the assignment operator (`=`) and the arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`) is inconsistent. The first line has spaces around the `=`, while the second line does not have spaces around the `=` operator.

#### How) for documentation.
