# NestedBlockDepth

This rule reports excessive nesting depth in functions. Excessively nested code becomes harder to read and increases
its hidden complexity. It might become harder to understand edge-cases of the function.

Prefer extracting the nested code into well-named functions to make it easier to understand.
